								<h1>Why consumers should embrace two-factor authentication</h1>
								<div class="date">May 2, 2013</div>
								<p>Two-factor authentication can make a big difference in keeping your information private. It's actually a pretty simple solution that doesn't require you to remember more complicated passwords, download special software or carry around a new gizmo. All you need is the phone in your pocket and about five seconds. Here's how two-factor authentication works: After you enter your login name and password into a website that has sensitive information, there is a pause.</p>

The attack also forced employees of The Times to take care in sending e-mails. The hacking was just the latest of a major media organization, with The Financial Times and The Washington Post also having their operations disrupted within the last few months.

								<p>Few Internet frustrations are so familiar as the password restriction. After creating a few (dozen) logins for all our Web presences, the use of symbols, mixed cases, and numbers seems less like a security measure and more like a torture device when it comes to remembering a complex password on a little-used site. But at least that variety of characters keeps you safe, right? As it turns out, there is some contrary research that supports both how frustrating these restrictions are and suggests it's possible that the positive effect of complexity rules on security may not be as great as long length requirements.</p>

								<div class="date">April 11, 2014</div>
								<p>The Heartbleed bug has made plain what everyone in cybersecurity already knew, whether they admit it or not: Passwords are dying. All of them. Got one of those fancy pieces of software that invents a unique and un-rememberable password for every one of your accounts? It's not enough. </p>

Dairy Queen says it has no indication of a card breach at any of its thousands of locations, but the company also acknowledges that nearly all stores are franchises and that there is no established company process or requirement that franchisees communicate security issues or card breaches to Dairy Queen headquarters.</p>

								<div class="date">July 31, 2013</div>
								<p> It's no secret that passwords -- the very basis of our online security -- are fundamentally flawed and insecure. It doesn't matter if you focus on user behavior (sharing the same password at multiple sites and creating simple, easy-to-crack codes) or on the back end where major sites frequently find their data compromised. Passwords are the single largest vulnerability in our modern lives.</p>
